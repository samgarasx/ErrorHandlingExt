## Introduction
This Error Handling extensions (Ext) is a library for modelling operations in a safe manner.

Using Ext, you can call synchronous and asynchronous operations and easily manage exceptions wrapping the data in a `Result/Result<T>` structure, adding extensions in order to respond to failure or success operations.

## Getting Started
You can view the [samples](https://github.com/samgarasx/ErrorHandlingExt/tree/master/ErrorHandlingExt.Samples) to know how to use this library.
